								<p>Imagined, designed and manage The Garage, a physical environment for Googlers to create, collaborate, experiment, fail, make connections and be a part of our own hacker/maker/design community.

								<p>Imagine a space where everything is on wheels, power drops from the ceiling, and you can write on the tables + walls. That's The Garage. The Garage facilitates creative collisions between all kinds of Googlers by providing a shared common space where Googlers can come together across departmental boundaries to co-learn, co-create and collaborate in ways that wouldn’t be possible in their cubicles.</p>

												<p class="grid_4">We worked with the architects to build flexibility into the infrastructure of the space. The network and power cables drop down from the ceiling on a grid so Googlers are never confined to an ethernet port or electrical outlet on the wall. They can move their desks almost anywhere in the room and power + networking should be in reach.</p>

								<p>Any Googler can reserve individual or smaller clusters of desks (aka “Parking Spaces”) in The Garage via Calendar to work on their 20% projects, host product design sprints, and facilitate team brainstorms &amp; summits.</p>
								<p>Since the design of The Garage exists to support the people in it, we organize experiences in The Garage to attract, grow and nurture a x-functional community of makers:
									<ul>
										<li><span class="emphasis">Garage Talks</span> provide a platform for internal &amp; external entrepreneurs to tell their stories.</li>
										<li><span class="emphasis">Design Thinking workshops &amp; rapid prototyping labs</span> teach Googlers practices and tools for human-centered iterative product design.</li>
										<li><span class="emphasis">Makers Classes</span> (including Intro to 3D Printing &amp; Intro to Electronics) give Googlers a hands-on introduction to the tools in the space.</li>
										<li><span class="emphasis">Hackathons</span> enable Googlers to work on small teams to build demos of experimental new ideas.</li>
										<li><span class="emphasis">Design Sprints</span> bring designers and engineers together to explore new directions for their products.</li>

								<h3 id="garage-last" class="heading">By the community for the community</h3>
								<p>The Garage is a commons, managed by a team of passionate volunteers. As a community, we created a set of (evolving) core values &amp; guidelines to help us all take care of the space together. The number 1 guideline: <span class="emphasis">Make it your own.</span></p>

								<p>At Google, we built an organizational mechanism for exploration and experimentation into the fabric of our company: we call it 20% time. Google empowers anyone in engineering to spend 20% of their time pursuing a project they are passionate about, if it has the potential to change the world.</p>
								<p>However, by December 2008, Google was a very different company than it was in 2001 when Krishna Bharat built a prototype of Google News in his 20% time... or when a small team built a demo for Gmail in their 20%, which launched in 2004. By 2008, only a very small percentage of engineers reported dedicating 20% of their time to experimental projects. We needed to scale the concept and the practice of 20% time with a growing Google.</p>
								<h3 class="heading">What we created</h3>
								<p>A team of us -- 3 engineers, a project manager, an ethnographer, and a UX researcher -- set out to help Googlers use their 20% time and use it effectively.</p>
								<p>In 2009 we piloted a program to bring together interdisciplinary teams to collaborate on a 20% project for an intense and focused period of time -- 20% team sprints (internally called “20% Task Forces”).</p>
								<p>We created an online open marketplace for 20% team sprints to help Googlers connect with each other and with projects they were passionate about. We scheduled 20% team sprint weeks during which teams of Googlers co-located and “pooled” their 20% time to focus on going from idea to demo in just 5 days.</p>
								<p>We set up weekly Beer &amp; Demos events for 20% team sprints (and any Googler) to present their demos to the broader community and get early feedback from their peers.</p> 
								<h3 id="20p-outcomes" class="heading">What came out of 20% Team Sprints</h3>
								<p>Within a year we were running monthly 20% team sprint events, and two years into the program over 200 Googlers accelerated 46 different projects in a 20% team sprint and launched 15 different products.</p>
								<p>Two examples of products that 20% team sprints jump-started:</p>

								<h3 class="heading">The spark for The Garage</h3>
								<p>In December 2011, we moved to a DIY service model, providing documentation for how to self-organize and run an effective 20% Team Sprint, and opening up the 20% Team Sprint lab so anyone at Google could reserve the space to collaborate as a team on-demand.</p>
								<p>The 20% team sprint lab served as a prototype for <span class="links"><a id="garage_link" href="#garage">The Garage</a></span>, a physical environment for collaboration &amp; experimentation.</p>

							<h1>Design Thinking</h1>
							<h2>Problem solving + prototyping</h2>
							<div class="story links">
								<p>When I first discovered Design Thinking at Stanford in the foundational Product Design course, ME101: Visual Thinking, I immediately loved how it applied the philosophy of improv (“yes, and!”) to problem solving and engineering.</p>
								<p>Design Thinking offers a mindset and a process for understanding a problem, empathizing with the user, exploring all the possible solutions and then quickly prototyping solutions to learn and get feedback.</p>
								<p>At Google, I joined a global team of facilitators to teach the hands-on workshop, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/unleashing-creativity-in-googles-csilab.html">Creative Skills for Innovation</a>, to spread design thinking throughout the organization.</p>
								<h3 class="heading">A Look at a Design Thinking workshop</h3>
								<p>In preparation for a 2014 California Academy of Sciences exhibit on biodiversity, I brought 50 Googlers together with 50 scientists, researchers, designers and exhibition developers to imagine and prototype innovative ideas for the exhibit.</p>
								<div id="design-slides" class="slides">

												<h1 class="grid_9">Observe &amp; Understand</h1>
												<img class="grid_5" src="images/design/Observing.jpg" alt="Observing">
												<p class="grid_4">Participants played the role of anthropologists, venturing into the museum with notebooks, cameras and open eyes and ears, on a mission to observe and interview museum visitors to understand their experiences, objectives and needs.</p>

												<img class="grid_5" src="images/design/Sharing.jpg" alt="Sharing">
												<p class="grid_4">Each team came together after a morning in the museum to share their observations and recount their interviews. Categorizing their notes into what they heard and saw, they listened for patterns and themes in an effort to synthesize what they learned and identify key insights. Through this process each team defined a specific challenge they wanted to address inspired by the museum, its visitors and their wants/needs.</p>

											<li class="slide clearfix brainstorm" id="design-5">
												<h1 class="grid_9">Ideate</h1>
												<div class="grid_9">
													<p>With a clear problem to solve -- one rooted in the experience of the museum visitor -- it was time to explore all the possible solutions.</p>
													<br>
													<p>Our brainstorming guidelines:</p>
												</div>
												<ul class="grid_5">
													<li><span class="emphasis">Defer judgment</span> - in brainstorming there are no bad ideas</li>
													<li><span class="emphasis">Go for quantity</span> - the more ideas the better</li>
													<li><span class="emphasis">Encourage wild ideas</span> - when brainstorming, anything is possible</li>
													<li><span class="emphasis">Be visual</span> - sketching is a great way to communicate ideas + sparks new ways of thinking</li>

												<h1 class="grid_9">Prototype</h1>
												<img class="grid_5" src="images/design/Prototype.jpg" alt="Prototyping">
												<p class="grid_4">After the divergent, generative process of brainstorming, it was time to converge on a solution and prototype. Without investing a ton of time, money or resources, prototyping allows you to learn more about your idea, communicate it in a more tangible way, and test it out with users. Teams used the materials in the room to build prototypes of their proposed exhibits.</p>
												<img class="grid_5 video" src="images/design/Video.jpg" alt="Prototyping">
											</li>
											<li class="slide clearfix" id="design-7">
												<h1 class="grid_9">Test</h1>
												<img class="grid_5" src="images/design/Feedback.jpg" alt="Giving Feedback">
												<p class="grid_4">The most valuable aspect of a prototype is that it enables you to get feedback on your ideas -- and you can then use that feedback to make your idea better. Members of each team acted as museum visitors, testing out each others’ prototypes and giving them feedback on their experiences.</p>
											</li>
											<li class="slide clearfix" id="design-8">
												<h1 class="grid_9">Present</h1>
												<img class="grid_5" src="images/design/Present.jpg" alt="Presenting">
												<p class="grid_4">At the end of the day, each group presented their final prototypes, which were recorded and archived. This Design Hackathon not only provided Googlers with the opportunity to get out into the world and connect with real users, but it also kicked-off a longer-term collaboration with the Academy, serving as an engaging way to imagine the possibilities for incorporating Google technology into the biodiversity exhibit to engage people in science and extend the exhibit beyond the Academy’s walls.</p>

							<h2>21st Century Salon Dinners</h2>
							<div class="summary">
								<h3 id="salon-first" class = "heading">What I do</h3>
								<p>Host and run a 21st Century Salon, bringing together my passion for designing experiences, communities and environments with my love of food. I gather curated groups of individuals for a home-cooked seasonal meal to connect, inspire, explore, build and learn.</p>
								<img class="center" src="images/salon/SalonTable_small.jpg" alt="The Dinner Table">
							</div><!-- .summary -->
							<div class="story">
								<p>In 2011 I piloted a private supper club from my home called Chez Mamie, because I love what happens when people sit around the dinner table getting to know each other while sharing a family-style meal. But Chez Mamie was missing something... For me, the magic of my favorite dinners wasn’t just about the food, it was about bringing together a particular group of people.</p>
								<p>Innovation happens when different people and ideas collide, and I wanted to be a catalyst for these collisions! As an homage to the mother of modernism, Gertrude Stein, I decided to transform Chez Mamie into a 21st century salon: Evenings at Case Study House #29.</p>
								<p>After experimenting with different formats for the dinners, each salon now focuses on a theme. I curate an eclectic interdisciplinary group of 10-12 people who do not all know each other, but who all share a connection to the topic.</p>
								<h3 class="heading">What happens at a salon dinner?</h3>
								<p>For the last Design Salon, participants came from IDEO and the d.school to the Designer Fund and Airbnb, from startups and freelancing to Facebook and Google. Their specialities ranged from User Experience Research to data visualization, and from product designers to software engineers.</p>
								<img class="center" src="images/salon/DesignSalon.png" alt="Invite">
								<p>I carefully craft the lead-up to each event to build a foundation for the community and a create shared knowledge &amp; understanding within the group. I want participants to show up to the Salon dinner feeling like they know each other -- and with specific conversations they are looking forward to.</p>
								<p>Two weeks before the Salon, I introduce everyone in a sketch + a few words:</p>
								<img class="center" src="images/salon/Intros_small.jpg" alt="Intros">
								<p>I use G+ Communities to create an online forum, sparking conversation with topical questions &amp; inviting participants to pose a big question to explore with this group over dinner.</p>
								<img class="center" src="images/salon/GoodDesign.jpg" alt="What is Good Design?">
								<br>
								<img class="center" src="images/salon/Questions.jpg" alt="Questions to ask at the table?">
								</div><!-- #salon-slides -->
								<p>When people arrive, I greet them with a seasonal cocktail, encouraging everyone get to know each other socially before taking our seats at the dining table. After kicking off the salon conversation, helping the group converge on 3 key questions they want to explore over the course of the meal, I alternate between host, cook, recorder and casual facilitator. With the 3 key questions defined and post-it pads &amp; sharpies at every place setting, the group organically facilitates itself, making connections between topics and ideas, tracking the time spent on each topic and noting any actions/todos that emerge.</p>
								<p>We return to the G+ Community after the fact to share links and compile our collective notes. The only thing missing is a more tangible artifact produced by the Salon -- but I’m playing with that next. :)</p>
